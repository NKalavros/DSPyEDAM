Love, Simon Anders, and Wolfgang Huber {#michael-i.-love-simon-anders-and-wolfgang-huber .author}\n\n#### 05/11/2025 {#section .date}\n\n::: abstract\nAbstract\n\nA basic task in the analysis of count data from RNA-seq is the detection\nof differentially expressed genes. The count data are presented as a\ntable which reports, for each sample, the number of sequence fragments\nthat have been assigned to each gene. Analogous data also arise for\nother assay types, including comparative ChIP-Seq, HiC, shRNA screening,\nand mass spectrometry. An important analysis question is the\nquantification and statistical inference of systematic changes between\nconditions, as compared to within-condition variability. The package\nDESeq2 provides methods to test for differential expression by use of\nnegative binomial generalized linear models; the estimates of dispersion\nand logarithmic fold changes incorporate data-driven prior\ndistributions. This vignette explains the use of the package and\ndemonstrates typical workflows. [An RNA-seq\nworkflow](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/) on the\nBioconductor website covers similar material to this vignette but at a\nslower pace, including the generation of count matrices from FASTQ\nfiles.

These data include\nsingle and dual channel microarray-based experiments measuring mRNA,\ngenomic DNA, and protein abundance, as well as non-array techniques such\nas serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), mass spectrometry\nproteomic data, and high-throughput sequencing data.\n\nAt the most basic level of organization of GEO, there are four basic\nentity types. The first three (Sample, Platform, and Series) are\nsupplied by users; the fourth, the dataset, is compiled and curated by\nGEO staff from the user-submitted data. See [the GEO home\npage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) for more information.\n\n::: {#platforms .section .level2}\n## [1.1]{.header-section-number} Platforms\n\nA Platform record describes the list of elements on the array (e.g.,\ncDNAs, oligonucleotide probesets, ORFs, antibodies) or the list of\nelements that may be detected and quantified in that experiment (e.g.,\nSAGE tags, peptides). Each Platform record is assigned a unique and\nstable GEO accession number (GPLxxx). A Platform may reference many\nSamples that have been submitted by multiple submitters.\n:::\n\n::: {#samples .section .level2}\n## [1.2]{.header-section-number} Samples\n\nA Sample record describes the conditions under which an individual\nSample was handled, the manipulations it underwent, and the abundance\nmeasurement of each element derived from it. Each Sample record is\nassigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSMxxx). A Sample\nentity must reference only one Platform and may be included in multiple\nSeries.\n:::\n\n::: {#series .section .level2}\n## [1.3]{.header-section-number} Series\n\nA Series record defines a set of related Samples considered to be part\nof a group, how the Samples are related, and if and how they are\nordered. A Series provides a focal point and description of the\nexperiment as a whole. Series records may also contain tables describing\nextracted data, summary conclusions, or analyses. Each Series record is\nassigned a unique and stable GEO accession number (GSExxx). Series\nrecords are available in a couple of formats which are handled by\nGEOquery independently. The smaller and new GSEMatrix files are quite\nfast to parse; a simple flag is used by GEOquery to choose to use\nGSEMatrix files (see below).\n:::\n\n::: {#datasets .section .level2}\n## [1.4]{.header-section-number} Datasets\n\nGEO DataSets (GDSxxx) are curated sets of GEO Sample data. A GDS record\nrepresents a collection of biologically and statistically comparable GEO\nSamples and forms the basis of GEO's suite of data display and analysis\ntools. Samples within a GDS refer to the same Platform, that is, they\nshare a common set of probe elements. Value measurements for each Sample\nwithin a GDS are assumed to be calculated in an equivalent manner, that\nis, considerations such as background processing and normalization are\nconsistent across the dataset. Information reflecting experimental\ndesign is provided through GDS subsets.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#getting-started-using-geoquery .section .level1}\n# [2]{.header-section-number} Getting Started using GEOquery\n\nGetting data from GEO is really quite easy. There is only one command\nthat is needed, `getGEO`. This one function interprets its input to\ndetermine how to get the data from GEO and then parse the data into\nuseful R data structures. Usage is quite simple. This loads the GEOquery\nlibrary.\n\n::: {#cb1 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\nlibrary(GEOquery)\n```\n:::\n\nNow, we are free to access any GEO accession. *Note that in the\nfollowing, I use a file packaged with the GEOquery package. In general,\nyou will use only the GEO accession, as noted in the code comments.*\n\n::: {#cb2 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\n# If you have network access, the more typical way to do this\n# would be to use this:\n# gds <- getGEO(\"GDS507\")\ngds <- getGEO(filename=system.file(\"extdata/GDS507.soft.gz\",package=\"GEOquery\"))\n```\n:::\n\nNow, `gds` contains the R data structure (of class `GDS`) that\nrepresents the GDS507 entry from GEO. You'll note that the filename used\nto store the download was output to the screen (but not saved anywhere)\nfor later use to a call to `getGEO(filename=...)`.\n\nWe can do the same with any other GEO accession, such as `GSM11805`, a\nGEO sample.\n\n::: {#cb3 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\n# If you have network access, the more typical way to do this\n# would be to use this:\n# gds <- getGEO(\"GSM11805\")\ngsm <- getGEO(filename=system.file(\"extdata/GSM11805.txt.gz\",package=\"GEOquery\"))\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#geoquery-data-structures .section .level1}\n# [3]{.header-section-number} GEOquery Data Structures\n\nThe GEOquery data structures really come in two forms. The first,\ncomprising `GDS`, `GPL`, and `GSM` all behave similarly and accessors\nhave similar effects on each. The fourth GEOquery data structure, `GSE`\nis a composite data type made up of a combination of `GSM` and `GPL`\nobjects. I will explain the first three together first.\n\n::: {#the-gds-gsm-and-gpl-classes .section .level2}\n## [3.1]{.header-section-number} The GDS, GSM, and GPL classes\n\nEach of these classes is comprised of a metadata header (taken nearly\nverbatim from the SOFT format header) and a GEODataTable. The\nGEODataTable has two simple parts, a Columns part which describes the\ncolumn headers on the Table part. There is also a `show` method for each\nclass. For example, using the gsm from above:\n\n::: {#cb4 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\n# Look at gsm metadata:\nhead(Meta(gsm))\n```\n:::\n\n    ## $channel_count\n    ## [1] \"1\"\n    ## \n    ## $comment\n    ## [1] \"Raw data provided as supplementary file\"\n    ## \n    ## $contact_address\n    ## [1] \"715 Albany Street, E613B\"\n    ## \n    ## $contact_city\n    ## [1] \"Boston\"\n    ## \n    ## $contact_country\n    ## [1] \"USA\"\n    ## \n    ## $contact_department\n    ## [1] \"Genetics and Genomics\"\n\n::: {#cb6 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\n# Look at data associated with the GSM:\n# but restrict to only first 5 rows, for brevity\nTable(gsm)[1:5,]\n```\n:::\n\n    ##           ID_REF  VALUE ABS_CALL\n    ## 1 AFFX-BioB-5_at  953.9        P\n    ## 2 AFFX-BioB-M_at 2982.8        P\n    ## 3 AFFX-BioB-3_at 1657.9        P\n    ## 4 AFFX-BioC-5_at 2652.7        P\n    ## 5 AFFX-BioC-3_at 2019.5        P\n\n::: {#cb8 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\n# Look at Column descriptions:\nColumns(gsm)\n```\n:::\n\n    ##     Column\n    ## 1         \n    ## 2    VALUE\n    ## 3 ABS_CALL\n    ##                                                                  Description\n    ## 1                                                                   ID_REF =\n    ## 2                         MAS 5.0 Statistical Algorithm (mean scaled to 500)\n    ## 3 MAS 5.0 Absent, Marginal, Present call  with Alpha1 = 0.05, Alpha2 = 0.065\n\nThe `GPL` class behaves exactly as the `GSM` class. However, the `GDS`\nclass has a bit more information associated with the `Columns` method:\n\n::: {#cb10 .sourceCode}\n``` {.sourceCode .r}\nColumns(gds)[,1:3]\n```\n:::\n\n    ##      sample disease.state individual\n    ## 1  GSM11815           RCC        035\n    ## 2  GSM11832           RCC        023\n    ## 3  GSM12069           RCC        001\n    ## 4  GSM12083           RCC        005\n    ## 5  GSM12101           RCC        011\n    ## 6  GSM12106           RCC        032\n    ## 7  GSM12274           RCC          2\n    ## 8  GSM12299           RCC          3\n    ## 9  GSM12412           RCC          4\n    ## 10 GSM11810        normal        035\n    ## 11 GSM11827        normal        023\n    ## 12 GSM12078        normal        001\n    ## 13 GSM12099        normal        005\n    ## 14 GSM12269        normal          1\n    ## 15 GSM12287        normal          2\n    ## 16 \n\n[Content truncated...]",
